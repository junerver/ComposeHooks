 * // Declare a suspend lambda like a normal lambda
 * val async = useAsync {
 *     delay(1.seconds)
 *     setState(state + 1)
 * }
 * // Easy to use
 * async()
 * ```
 *
 * @param block The suspend function to be executed when the returned function is called
 * @return A function that, when called, executes the provided suspend function in a coroutine scope
